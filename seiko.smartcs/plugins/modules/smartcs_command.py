module: smartcs_command
author: "Seiko Solutions Inc. (@naka-shin1)"
short_description: Run commands on remote devices running SmartCS
description:
- Sends arbitrary commands to an SmartCS node and returns the results
  read from the device. This module includes an
  argument that will cause the module to wait for a specific condition
  before returning or timing out if the condition is not met.
  This module does not support running commands in configuration mode.
  Please use M(seiko.smartcs.smartcs_config) to configure SmartCS.
version_added: 1.3.0
extends_documentation_fragment:
- seiko.smartcs.smartcs
notes:
- Tested against SmartCS NS-2250 System Software Ver 2.1
options:
  commands:
    description:
    - List of commands to send to the remote smartcs over the
      configured provider. The resulting output from the command
      is returned. If the I(wait_for) argument is provided, the
      module is not returned until the condition is satisfied or
      the number of retries has expired. If a command sent to the
      device requires answering a prompt, it is possible to pass
      a dict containing I(command), I(answer) and I(prompt).
      Common answers are 'y' or "\\r" (carriage return, must be
      double quotes). See examples.
    required: true
    type: list
    elements: raw
  wait_for:
    description:
    - List of conditions to evaluate against the output of the
      command. The task will wait for each condition to be true
      before moving forward. If the conditional is not true
      within the configured number of retries, the task fails.
      See examples.
    aliases:
    - waitfor
    type: list
    elements: str
  match:
    description:
    - The I(match) argument is used in conjunction with the
      I(wait_for) argument to specify the match policy.  Valid
      values are C(all) or C(any).  If the value is set to C(all)
      then all conditionals in the wait_for must be satisfied.  If
      the value is set to C(any) then only one of the values must be
      satisfied.
    default: all
    type: str
    choices:
    - any
    - all
  retries:
    description:
    - Specifies the number of retries a command should by tried
      before it is considered failed. The command is run on the
      target device every retry and evaluated against the
      I(wait_for) conditions.
    default: 10
    type: int
  interval:
    description:
    - Configures the interval in seconds to wait between retries
      of the command. If the command does not pass the specified
      conditions, the interval indicates how long to wait before
      trying the command again.
    default: 1
